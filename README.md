In an exciting venture as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certification, I focused on developing a predictive model to forecast the successful recovery of SpaceX's Falcon 9 first-stage boosters. The project encapsulated various facets of data science and machine learning, including:

Data Acquisition: Gathered comprehensive data from SpaceX's API and Wikipedia, detailing launch specifics, booster versions, payload data, and recovery outcomes.

Data Cleaning and Transformation: Implemented rigorous data preprocessing to create a binary classification for landing success and refined the dataset for analysis.

Insightful Data Analysis: Utilized SQL for data extraction and Folium for interactive mapping, offering deep insights into launch patterns and outcomes.

Machine Learning Implementation: Developed various models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and KNN, optimizing them with GridSearchCV.

Model Evaluation and Accuracy: Achieved an impressive 83.33% accuracy, using confusion matrices for detailed model performance analysis.

Interactive Data Visualization: Crafted a dynamic dashboard using Plotly Dash, highlighting successful landings and critical launch metrics.

Skill Application: Demonstrated proficiency in Python, SQL, machine learning techniques, data visualization, and statistical analysis.

Project Impact: The analysis provided vital predictions for SpaceY, supporting cost-effective and successful space missions in the burgeoning field of commercial spaceflight.

This endeavor not only showcased my skills in data science but also significantly contributed to the advancement of predictive analytics in space technology
